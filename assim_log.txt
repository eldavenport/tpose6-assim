Assimilation Experiments:

Sep2012 Velocity Assimilation 
- located: sep2012/run_ad
- total iters: 22
- best iter: 20
- fwd runs: sep2012/iter0, sep2012/iter20
- includes all TAO constraints (velocity, T, S)
- includes velocity controls 
- initialized from TPOSE6 (no TAO assim)

Sep2012 Velocity Withheld
- located: sep2012/velocity_withhold/run_ad
- total iters:
- best iter:
- fwd runs: sep2012/iter0
- includes only TAO T and S, no velocity **constraints**
- does include velocity controls 

Nov2012 Velocity Assimilation
- located: nov2012/run_ad
- total iters: 
- best iter: 
- fwd runs: nov2012/iter0
- includes all TAO constraints (velocity, T, S)
- updated uncertainty on the velocity obs (and controls?)
- updated TAO profile weights in files: TAO_WO_2012_ADCP_v2.nc, TAO_WO_2012_CUR_v2.nc
- initialized from sep2012 with velocity assim

Changing Between Runs:
- add new initialized state into previous_state/
	- ex: T_assim_2013.data and .meta
- update input/data (or data_ad) to use the updated previous state files
	- at the bottom of data
- add necessary constraints and linked_files (e.g., 2013 constraints)
	- update data.profiles
	- no updates necessary to data.ecco or data.exf


Adding velocity contraints:
- add weights to profiles (make sure weights are 0 for -9999 values)
- add profiles to constraints/ 
- update data.profiles to includes new constraints
- for velocity, need to add prof_names(_,3) = 'prof_U' and prof_names(_,4) = 'prof_V'
- add prof_namesmod(_,3) = 'UE' and prof_namesmod(_,4) = 'VN
	- example:
		profilesfiles(7) = 'TAO_WO_2012_ADCP',
 		prof_names(7,3) = 'prof_U',
		prof_names(7,4) = 'prof_V',
		prof_namesmod(7,3) = 'UE',
		prof_namesmod(7,4) = 'VN',

Adding velocity controls:
- add weights to linked_files/ (need to be .bin with float32's in big endian format)
- update input/data.ctrl_ad to include new ctrl vars
	- example: 
		xx_genarr3d_weight(3) = 'TAO_uvel_wt_tp6.bin',
		xx_genarr3d_file(3)='xx_uvel',
		xx_genarr3d_preproc(1,3)='smooth',
		mult_genarr3d(3) = 1.0,
- update packing and unpacking (input/data.ctrl_pack)
- add flags #define ALLOW_UVEL0_CONTROL and ALLOW_VVEL0_CONTROL to CTRL_OPTIONS.h 
	- this needs to be done for all code folders (including fwd run)
	- rebuild all executables
	- optim will now fail if the max number of control vars was set to the exact # 
	- increase the number of control vars based on optim error output 
	- rebuild optim 

Future testing to look at the value of the improved initial conditions:
- run forward (like from 2 months into the run) with initial condition from TPOSE6 and initial condition from velocity estimation
- rerun iter20 forward run without uv controls - see how much the cost changes (explicitly asking what is the value of optimized u v initial state)
