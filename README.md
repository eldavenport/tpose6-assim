# TPOSE6 Assimilation

This project contains code modifications and input files to run the tpose6 assimilations and sensitivity studies with TAO moorings and velocity observations. This uses the MITgcm at checkpoint68w and the optimization package [optim_m1qn3](https://github.com/mjlosch/optim_m1qn3).

Use [mitgcm-assim](https://github.com/eldavenport/mitgcm-assim) to analyze cost function and control effort.
